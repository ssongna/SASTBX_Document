About SASTBX
----------------
The Small Angle Scattering ToolBox (SASTBX) is an open-source software for biomolecular small-angle scattering. 

----------------------------
What can SASTBX do for you
----------------------------
Analysis SAS data.

* **Data reduction**

  Obtain one-dimensional scattering curves of intensity versus scattering vector (I-q curves).

* **PDDF**

 The intensity profile can be transformed to the pair distance distribution function.

* **Shape retrieval**

 Find plausible low resolution models that fit the experimental data.
 
* **Superpose Model**

 Superpose models at low resolutions.
